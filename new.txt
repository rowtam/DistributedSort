        * netsvcs/lib/Client_Logging_Handler.cpp (fini):
          Make sure to dynamically allocate the logger_key_ and
          server_host_ so that we don't end up with weird memory problems.
          Thanks to Dmitry Ergy <dergy@websci.ru> for reporting this.
        * ace/config-irix6.x-common.h: Added
          ACE_LACKS_PLACEMENT_OPERATOR_DELETE to keep Irix compilers from
          complaining!  Thanks to David for reporting this.

        * ace/OS.cpp (inherit_log_msg): Added a comment explaining why
          we don't inherit the callback when a new thread is created -
          since all hell would break loose otherwise if it came off the
          stack!  Thanks to Sangwoo Jin <swjinjin@sei.co.kr> for
          motivating this clarification.
